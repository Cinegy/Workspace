# Cinegy Workspace

Cinegy Workspace empowers media production teams to collaborate on projects wherever they are â€“ in the office, at home or on the road. Cinegy Workspace provides secure access to your Cinegy Archive database from anywhere at any time. All that is required is a standard computer or laptop, and a regular internet connection. Using the Cinegy Workspace browser-based interface, clips can be searched, browsed, selected and even subclipped. Users can participate in a collaborative workflow even when they are based in different locations.

In contrast to previous versions Cinegy Workspace 21 does not require any browser plugins, it is a pure JavaScript and HTML5 based client.

The recommended browsers for running Cinegy Workspace are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, however it should also work in most available web browsers.

     Please note - back-end packages are available only via the Cinegy Portal for customers 
     with a valid SLA for Cinegy Archive & Workspace.
